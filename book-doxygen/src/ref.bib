The creation of API reference documentation and its integration into larger documentation sets present a number of challenges. This paper explores a strategy for using Javadoc, the primary mechanism for generating Java API documentation, in conjunction with an XML infrastructure, to improve the quality of API reference material and its integration into product documentation sets.

This paper describes in a general way the process we went through to determine the goals, principles, audience, content and style for writing comments in source code for the Java platform at the Java Software division of Sun Microsystems. This includes how the documentation comments evolved to become the home of the Java platform API specification, and the guidelines we developed to make it practical for this document to reside in the same files as the source code.
